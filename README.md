# Your Life in Weeks

This program tells you how many days, weeks, months you have left if you live until 90 years old. 

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with your time left in this format:

> You have x days, y weeks, and z months left. 

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
